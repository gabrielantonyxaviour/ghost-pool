# Prompt 11: Deploy Contracts to Casper Testnet

## Context
Contracts are built and tested locally. Now deploy to Casper 2.0 testnet.

## Task
Deploy the contracts:

### 1. Get Testnet CSPR
- Use Casper testnet faucet: https://testnet.cspr.live/faucet
- Need ~1000 CSPR for deployments and testing

### 2. Configure Livenet Environment
Update `contracts/Odra.toml`:
```toml
[livenet]
chain_name = "casper-test"
node_address = "https://rpc.testnet.casperlabs.io/rpc"
secret_key_path = "<path-to-secret-key>"
```

### 3. Deploy Test Token First
```bash
cd contracts
cargo run --bin ghost_pool_livenet --features livenet
```
- Deploy TestToken with initial supply
- Note the contract hash

### 4. Deploy Pool Contract
```bash
cargo run --bin ghost_pool_livenet --features livenet
```
Deploy with arguments:
- `token_address`: TestToken contract hash
- `validator`: Valid testnet validator public key
- `treasury`: Your account address
- `admin`: Your account address

### 5. Record Deployed Addresses
Update `frontend/src/lib/constants.ts`:
```typescript
export const POOL_CONTRACT_HASH = "hash-...";
export const TOKEN_CONTRACT_HASH = "hash-...";
```

### 6. Verify Deployment
- Check contracts on testnet explorer
- Call read functions to verify initialization

## Verification
- Both contracts deployed successfully
- Can call view functions
- Contract hashes recorded in frontend
